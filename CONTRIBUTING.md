# Contributing to p0d

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/simonmittag/p0d), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/simonmittag/p0d). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [Apache License](https://github.com/simonmittag/p0d/blob/master/LICENSE). Feel free to contact one of the project
maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/simonmittag/p0d/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug
by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/simonmittag/p0d/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with necessary detail, background, and sample code

p0d is a http client. Filing bugs right now is simple and should include either mention of failing tests.
