## What is p0d?
![](p0d.png)

p0d is a go based HTTP performance testing tool. It can be configured via cli or yml. p0d
runs HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests in parallel against your server and provides detailed
reports on the output. p0d is alpha grade software under active development.

## Up and running

### Golang
```bash
go get github.com/simonmittag/p0d && 
go install github.com/simonmittag/p0d/cmd/p0d && 
p0d -h
```

## Usage

### With cli args
```
Î» p0d -h
  Usage of p0d:
  -C string
        load configuration from yml file
  -O string
        save detailed JSON output to file
  -c int
        maximum amount of parallel TCP connections used (default 1)
  -d int
        time in seconds to run p0d (default 10)
  -h string
        http version to use. Values are 1.1 and 2 (which works only with TLS URLs). 
        Defaults to 1.1
  -t int
        amount of parallel execution threads (default 1)
  -u string
        url to use
  -v    print p0d version
```

### With config file
`pod -c config.yml`

#### req.method
http request method, usually one of `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`

#### req.url
server url to run against

#### req.headers
list of headers to include in the request. use this to inject i.e. authentication

#### res.code
the expected http resonse code. if not matched, request counts as failed in test summary

#### exec.logsampling
ratio between 0 and 1 of requests to keep when saving results to disk with -O

#### exec.mode
`binary` or `decimal` for MiB or MB units in reporting

#### exec.spacingMillis
artificial spacing in milliseconds, introduced before sending each request.

#### exec.httpVersion
preferred http version. Allowable values are 1.1. and 2. Defaults to 1.1. Please note that HTTP/2 is only
supported using TLS. Http version is negotiated, not absolute and HTTP/2 may fall back to HTTP/1.1
